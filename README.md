A habbit building tool focused on simplicity and community. 

Built with Flutter.

## Running the App


### On a local machine
For running the app in a developement make sure to install ['Flutter'](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install). Currently, only the android version of the app has been tested, so you'll need to install everything required for flutter developement on android.

To run the app, make sure this machine is connected to an android device. This can be a physical phone in developement mode connected via usb, or a running android emulator. To find the identity of your connected devices, you can enter

`flutter devices`.


This project has a non-default entry point. You'll have to specify it in the `run` command.

`flutter run lib/entrypoints/prod/main_prod.dart -d`
